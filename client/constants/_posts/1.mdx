I bet you have some great plans for the future! You may want to quit your job earlier and retire before your parents. Or you just want to build a habit for saving up money on a monthly basis. You are at the good place!
### The main goal

My main goal is to build a community, where people from beginners to experienced to passive income can share their valuable knowledge and questions.

### Who am I, you may ask?

To be honest, I am a young one working in the Software Industry and came across this investment topic a few years ago. At that time, I was really beginner to passive income sources. Thankfully, a few of my colleagues already had experience, so we started to share our experience so far. Then I realized that there must be much more in this than just a hobby.

### Turns out to be serious

Story time: I started to take this topic seriously. I remember it was a rainy afternoon. I was listening to Africa from Toto while sipping a mug of tea and suddenly thunder struck through my brain. The following may not be exactly what happened, but what I discovered was that I am the exact age at which almost every long term investment book recommends starting this investment.

### Since then...

...I read a lot of passive income books, participated in webinars ('thanks' Covid) and started to implement this strategy in real life. I spent 2021 performing calculations, choosing platforms, learning some tips and tricks on how to select ‘worthy’ companies.
