## Investing or speculating

If you are reading different financial newspapers you usually come 
along that these journals use the investor for almost everything.
According to them, everyone who participates in any kind of financial
transaction or buys or sells any financial instrument is considered
an investor.

_What is the main difference between them and why is
it so important to make a distinction between investing and speculating?_

### Speculation

According to my view - and this is heavily influenced by Benjamin Graham's work -
everything is considered speculation where the purchase of stocks
are not backed with strong fundamentals and analysis, planned to hold
it only for price fluctuations. 

**If you do speculate, someone else in the future should pay more
for the stocks as you did.**

Otherwise, you will be the fool at the end of the line, who paid the more
for a bunch of stocks.

> This is an extremely **dangerous** type of investment, and everyone should
be aware of the cons of it.

### What is considered speculation?

Rushing for the latest IPO? Speculation. Hoping that the price for Amazon will
be higher one months from now? Speculation. Sell stocks for short, hoping
that the market will finally collapse and you can buy back the shares
for less? Speculation.

_Everything, that is not backed by strong fundamentals are considered speculative
business._

### Pros and cons of speculation

1. Speculating has an enourmous amount of emotion involved in. That is why
a lot of people are really addicted to day- or week-trading. If you
are in this group and you think that it is great, okay. For me,
sleeping well at night worth more than anything.

2. You can earn with it - but only with a tremendous amount of luck and
only for a short period. Otherwise, you would be leading a mutual fund. 
You will lose money in the long-run.

3. If you are trading from borrowed money or do sell for short,
you can lose much more money than you can afford.

## Investing

Things start to get more exciting when we start to discuss what investing really is.
It is rather a boring and emotionless, repetative mechanism. 
Usually you look for companies with stable, but small earning growth potential.

You will not invest in the next Amazon nor in the next Tesla. 

Your portfolio will reach the highest return if you completely eliminate
yourself - at least your emotions. 

**If you do invest, you will hold your stocks almost forever. You had better
not to kill your best cows.**

> This is an extremely **boring** type of investment, and everyone should be aware of it.

### What is considered investment?

According to my dictionary, everything that is backed by emotionless,
clear and well-defined selection mechanism. 

When you do not have to check the prices on an hourly basis. Where you are
aware that you should be a part owner of this company for the rest of your life.

### Pros and cons of investing

It is hard to separate the two, because really depends on the person itself.

1. I would argue that this a con, but it is boring as hell. Nothing happens,
prices fluctuates as usual - a bit less than non-value stocks - and you wait
your next dividend to land on your account.

2. It won't make you richer than Warren Buffett within three months. I know that everyone
wants to be super rich within months or even weeks, but that is rarely the case - of course
if you inherit that amount of money, this could happen. It is a slow process while compounding 
really takes effect.

3. The con is that it is bulletproof, well tested, implemented by several investor - sadly not by a lot.

Please note that past performance is not an indicator of future performance. Prices fluctuate and
you can lose money on your investments.
