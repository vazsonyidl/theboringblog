## REITs

Thanks the definition, Sherlock. They are modeled after mutual funds and makes possible
for individual investors to harvest dividends from real estate **without the pain to buy,
manage, maintain the properties.*

### Requirements to form a REIT

Let's start with an unusual idea. What kind of requirements do you have to meet if you want
to form a REIT by yourself? I think this helps to understand REITs in detail.

<em>There are some basic details - like the shares should be tradable - which we will skip, and focus on
the more important ones.</em>

1. At least 75% of a REIT income must come from real-estate related income. Rents from real property and interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property.
 Maximum 5% of a REIT's income can be from non-qualifying sources - like service fees or a non-real estate business. 

2. A REIT must distribute at least 90% of its taxable income. The retained income is taxable with the same
rate as any other corporations' income.

With the basic understanding of what are the main requirements to form a Real Estate Investment Trust,
you can imagine the companies underlying assets.

### Is the high yield a sign for caution?

If you just generally check out some REITs, you will see yields between 5% to 10%, generally. Of course, there are
entities yielding less or more than these. Is it a problem or some warning sing that you should be aware of?

#### Why the yield has changed?

Lets put the current stock market into perspective a bit. The previous generation of company leaders mostly were from the so called 
'Golden Generation'. They were born before the two awful World War and usually managed/lead companies until their 60s/70s.
They had a plan to retire and they had a chance to retire. Their goal was to build and manage profitable companies that has relative stable
and high yield - because they knew that they can retire on that stable yield. Plus the de-facto standard bond, the 10 year US Treasury Bond yielded
somewhere between 4% to 10%. Life was cool, inflation was super low and people knew how to enjoy their life at the end.

**Boomers**

Currently we are in an age where companies mostly led by the 'Boomer generation'. Somehow they do not really want to retire.
I am pretty sure that both you and I can agree, that Microsoft (MSFT:NYSE) <1% yield (at the time of writing) is a joke.
Okay, it is a software company, but if the management would really want, the company would be able to pay a way higher dividend, somewhere between
4% to 6%. From this perspective, the REITs yield are not so high (and risky) at all, so that initial fear should be less and less 
frigthening now. 

> It is simply not in their favor. 

Which is better? Paying dividends out, or playing around with the 'free' money as long as the company has enough high EPS that you can
call your next compensation package? Yeah, you guessed right. 

_I am not blaming them or anything, they are awesome managers/CEOs. They do a wonderful job.

We simply have to understand this change in their mindset, because at the end of the day, **I would like to retire**.
For that, I want a stable combination of middle percentage yield (from 5% to 8%).
