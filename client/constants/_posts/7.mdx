## REITs

Thanks the definition, Sherlock. They are modeled after mutual funds and makes possible
for individual investors to harvest dividends from real estate **without the pain to buy,
manage, maintain the properties.*

### Requirements to form a REIT

Let's start with an unusual idea. What kind of requirements do you have to meet if you want
to form a REIT by yourself? I think this helps to understand REITs in detail.

<em>There are some basic details but - like the shares should be tradable - which we will skip, and focus on
the more important ones.</em>

1. At least 75% of a REIT income must come from real-estate related income. Rents from real property and interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property.
 Maximum 5% of a REIT's income can be from non-qualifying sources - like service fees or a non-real estate business. 

2. A REIT must distribute at least 90% of its taxable income. The retained income is taxable with the same
rate as any other corporation.

With the basic understanding of what a Real Estate Investment Trust is, we can focus on the next question.

### Why is it worth investing in REITs?
