## REITs

Thanks the definition, Sherlock. They are modeled after mutual funds and makes possible
for individual investors to harvest dividends from real estate **without the pain to buy,
manage, maintain the properties.*

### Requirements to form a REIT

Let's start with an unusual idea. What kind of requirements do you have to meet if you want
to form a REIT by yourself? I think this helps to understand REITs in detail.

**There are some basic details - like the shares should be tradable - which we will skip, and focus on
the more important ones.**

1. At least 75% of a REIT income must come from real-estate related income. Rents from real property and interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property.
 Maximum 5% of a REIT's income can be from non-qualifying sources - like service fees or a non-real estate business. 

2. A REIT must distribute at least 90% of its taxable income. The retained income is taxable with the same
rate as any other corporations' income.

With the basic understanding of what are the main requirements to form a Real Estate Investment Trust,
you can imagine the companies underlying assets.

### Is the high yield a sign for caution?

If you just generally check out some REITs, you will see yields between 5% to 10%, generally. Of course, there are
entities yielding less or more than these. Is it a problem or some warning sing that you should be aware of?

#### Why the yield has changed?

Lets put the current stock market into perspective a bit. The previous generation of company leaders mostly were from the so called 
'Golden Generation'. They were born before the two awful World War and usually managed/lead companies until their 60s/70s.
They had a plan to retire and they had a chance to retire. Their goal was to build and manage profitable companies that has relative stable
and high yield - because they knew that they can retire on that stable yield. Plus the de-facto standard bond, the 10 year US Treasury Bond yielded
somewhere between 4% to 10%. Life was cool, inflation was super low and people knew how to enjoy their life at the end.

**Boomers**

Currently we are in an age where companies mostly led by the 'Boomer generation'. Somehow they do not really want to retire.
I am pretty sure that both you and I can agree, that Microsoft (MSFT:NYSE) < 1% yield (at the time of writing) is a joke.
Okay, it is a software company, but if the management would really want, the company would be able to pay a way higher dividend, somewhere between
4% to 6%. From this perspective, the REITs yield are not so high (and risky) at all, so that initial fear should be less and less 
frigthening now. 

> It is simply not in their favor. 

Which is better? Paying dividends out, or playing around with the 'free' money as long as the company has enough high EPS that you can
call your next compensation package? Yeah, you guessed right. 

_I am not blaming them or anything, they are awesome managers/CEOs. They do a wonderful job.

We simply have to understand this change in their mindset, because at the end of the day, **I would like to retire**.
For that, I want a stable combination of middle percentage yield (from 5% to 8%). 

### Why to invest in REITs?

The question may sound silly, of course because of the yield, but there are other aspects as well. Historycally, 
real-estate remained the escape-route for a lot of people. Except in the short period of the 2008 housing bubble, if
you check out 15-20 years time span, real estate prices always go higher and higher. This goes in tandem with renting prices.
When was the last time, when your landlord reached you out to reduce the rent? Sounds an unusual occasion, to be honest.

*Even though it feels like we constantly live in a real-estate bubble again, it will not explode.*

I think investing in real-estate is being a part-owner of one of the most stable asset class available. REITs help
you reach this with limited headache.

### Types of REITs

The two main types are equity REIT (REIT) and mortgage REIT (mREIT).

**REIT**
These real estate companies own properties in a range of real estate sectors that are leased to tenants,
such as office buildings, shopping centers and other complexes.
They distribute the bulk of their income to shareholders in the form of dividends.

**mREIT**

Mortgage REITs (mREITS) provide financing for income-producing real estate by purchasing or originating mortgages 
and mortgage-backed securities and earning income from the interest on these investments.

> Mortgage REITs are generally include higher risk.

You can subgroup the two main groups based on what kind of real-estate properties do they own.

Just to name some:

1. Office REITs
2. Industrial REITs
3. Retails REITs
4. Residental REITs
5. Data Center REITs

...and the list can go on. Each of these REITs operate in special niche.

## How do rising interes rates affect the performance of REITs?

Usually, REITs have a high debt and that is mostly because of their business model.
How do rising interest rates affect REITs? There might be some correlation, but lets see what happened

Standard and Poor's reviewed six periods during the early 1970s, during which the 10-year Treasury note
yield increased significantly. **The study showed, that REITs recorder a positive total return 4 times (40%) and 
beat the market 5 times (50%).**

Because REITs distribute at least 90% of their taxable income, there is not a lot retained earnings. If they want
to grow, they either have to raise equity from new investors or get on more debt.

With rising interest rates, putting on more loans are more costly, so these makes REITs less profitable during
these times.

In these scenarios, the best REITs can grow their equities despite rising interest rates. 

In my opinion, the conclusion is that it is safe to buy REITs even before or during rising interes rates
period. *The key here is consistency.* Buy them when interest rates are low, aceeptable, high, acceptalbe and low again.
Time is your best friend.
