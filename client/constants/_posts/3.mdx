### Intro

Before jumping into the rules and the process to pick potential candidates, there is another important thing. In my opinion, this will be one of the most useful one. The behaviour. Without these characteristic, people can bend easily with the wind and give up an otherwise rock solid plan to build a compounding machine. But enough from small-talk, jump into the details and review them step by step!
    
### Be adoptable

I think it speaks for itself. The times fly by as well as all the previous metrics, tips and analysis. One of the crucial mindset one has to have when fighting through the enormous amount of information in this area is to be adoptable. Metric, numbers and key factors measured in 1992, during the dotcom bubble or around the 2008 crisis will not be helpful now. 

To have a good overall view, **one must have to check the valuation of a company based on the current trends** - both the industry of which the company operates as well as the overall market.
    
### Do not buy if there is no good option
This will rarely be a case, because there will always be another option. **But if not, do not buy!** Simply just keep your money as a free cash (maybe on your investment account or bank account) because the sun will rise tomorrow, there will be several news and what might be priced ‘high’ today maybe will be a better option 3 weeks from now.
    
### Do not "fall in love"
At least not with companies! People usually like to favor one company over another just because it is fancy or more popular. The sad thing is even a company is hyped can have really bad results if measured with your long-term return eyeglasses on. My suggestion is not to fall in love with brand names, possible future outcomes, Twitter posts.
    
### Do not want to beat the market
I wish I could have Morgan Freeman’s record as he is whispering this phrase, on repeat. **Beating the market is something that you should never sign up for.** You do not chase high return from selling TSLA short before Elon Musk’s latest Tweet. You rather want a **stable, reliable compounding machine** on top of which you can plan a life.
    
### Footnote

Please always do your own research when buying! These are just the key characteristics according to my perspective - some of them cited from the Single Best Investment book.

> *high returns = high quality + high current yield + growth of yield*
