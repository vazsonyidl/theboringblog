When you start picking stocks into your basket, I assume that you want the best ones - the golden eggs.
Even though, these eggs must match some criteria you set up - based on your own perspective. This can be that
the company should pay dividend for at least 10 years, no dividend cut in this period, payout ratio below 60%, etc.

These are usually the basic metrics people pick their dividend payers with - and most of the dividend investors agree on this.

But there is usually one cruital point where I usually encounter debates. The percentage of the yield 
required from a company to put into the basket. 

**Why is this debate is on and how will it affect your long term goals?**

Let me examine this question in the following lines. Join me!

## Yield

If you check out the exact same company's yield now and a week from now, you can see completely different values.
I do not say it will go from 1% to 10% or vice-versa all of a sudden, but you can see some 0.1%-0.3% change.

Why? Because the yield is:

<figure>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The dividend yield, expressed as a percentage, is a financial ratio (dividend/price) that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year <em>relative to its stock price.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption><cite><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendyield.asp" target='_blank'>Yield</a></cite> on Investopedia.</figcaption>
</figure>

So the sad and the good news at the same time is: the price heavily influences the yield. 

The good part is, if a stock price falls because of some
uncertain panic on the market, you can buy the same - high quality - company for a better price with a higher yield. 

The sad part is, if the price of a company's stock grows in (at least) tandem with the dividend growth - or event faster -, then the yield
will stay in that exact low yield percentage it is trapped currently.

## High yielders

There are several great resources for determining the yield of particular sectors. Some does it within the US market, some within the S&P 500 only.

The MRQ (most recent quarter) yield by sector is the following as of the writing of this article <em>2022 Q2.</em>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>S&P 1500</td>
      <td>1.92%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


As you can see, the higher yielders are the Telecommunication services (AT&T, Verizon) and Utilities (pick one you like).

If you generally take a look, the high yielders are *well established businesses* with usually a *low growth potential.*

Telecommunication services have serious competition.
