## Introduction

This project was created with the idea to start a blog about long term investing.
This is the project source, and the code will live on a publicly available domain - to share my experience with anyone interested in.

### Technologies used

> Backend


For backend, I plan to use Django with DRF to create a consumable API. If this turns out to be an overkill, I will switch to a _serverless_ solution.

> Frontend

For the frontend, I will use React.js. This is my choice, because of learning purposes as well as to maintain the project and the site later.
