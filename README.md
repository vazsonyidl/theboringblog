# The boring blog

Which actually is a long-term investment blog and community. The page and the community was created to share knowledge about long term investment. 

# Resources

Some useful resources will be listed here:

Benjamin Graham - The Intelligent Investor


# API for charts

Suddenly, I found a great source [here](https://iexcloud.io).

Use this API for development purposes, consider using it in production as well. 
Take care of API call call limitations.

# RSS feeds

RSS news feeds are required to fetch up-to-date information about new's headlines.
From these headlines, my goal is to create a sentimental analysis with - and here comes
THE abbreviation - AI to depict the markets overall feeling.

For this, I have to process the following RSS feeds' various options.

### RSS feeds resources

1. [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/page/feeds)
2. [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/news/rss-news-and-feeds)
3. [Morningstar](https://news.morningstar.com/rss/rss.html)
4. [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/rss)
5. [Marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/rss/)
6. [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/rss)

My idea here is to create a globe - 3D animated - and display news based on the possible source.
