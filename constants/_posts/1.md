### The main goal

Put it simply, to retire in 11 years - exactly in 2033. I will achieve this! But during this period I want to share my every day experience in this topic, so you may set up a similar goal for yourself.

### Who am I, you may ask?

To be honest, I am a young one working in the Software Industry and came across this investment topic a few years ago. Thankfully, a few of my colleagues already had experience, so I just absorbed every information they shared with me. Then I realized that there must be much more in this than just a hobby.

### Turns out to be serious

Story time: I started to take this topic seriously. I remember it was a rainy afternoon. I was listening to Africa from Toto while sipping a mug of tea and suddenly thunder struck through my brain. The following may not be exactly what happened, but what I discovered was that I am the exact age at which almost every book recommends starting this investment.

### Since then...

...I read a lot of books, participated in webinars ('thanks' Covid) and started to implement this strategy in real life. I spent 2021 performing calculations, choosing platforms, learning some tips and tricks on how to select ‘worthy’ companies.
